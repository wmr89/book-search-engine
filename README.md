# book-search-engine

## Description

AS an avid reader I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase.

This project utilizes a full MERN stack and deploys with render. Along with practicing with a full-stack application, this project gave me the opportunity to practice the important skill of refactoring existing code.
